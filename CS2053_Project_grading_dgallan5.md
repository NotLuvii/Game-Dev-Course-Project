    Comments:  Overall fun and relatable game. A couple points off for the AI being single state (move or stationary)

    Grade: 18
    Comments: A bit difficult to know how to heal without the explanation on the readme (should probably have a screen on the menu for explanation). Also tough to tell sometimes where the stress damage is coming from


3. 10%: complexity and challenge in implementation
	
	Grade: 8
    Comments: Minor collidor issues with doorways, fun mechanic with the spoons and health, overall 

4. 10%: aesthetics/design/story

    Grade: 9
    Comments: Seems to be a race condition on directional animations, and more of the story should be explicitly in the game rather than in the readme.
